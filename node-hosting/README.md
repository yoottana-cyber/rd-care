# RD CONNECT — DirectAdmin Node.js + MariaDB (Migration-only)

## Not production-ready

This folder is a **fail-closed scaffold** for an isolated school-hosting migration. It does **not** implement any of the existing RD CONNECT login, enrollment, attendance, QR, behavior, merit, admin or Push APIs yet.

- `GET /api/health` intentionally returns HTTP **503** `migration_not_ready`.
- All `/api/*` endpoints not yet ported return HTTP **501** `endpoint_not_migrated`.
- Non-API URLs return 404. This scaffold does **not** serve the existing PWA.
- No automatic MySQL connection, schema writes, Cloudflare fallback or data import occurs.
- Do not point the existing Dev PWA or any real student/guardian accounts at this app.

## Files

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `app.js` | CommonJS startup for CloudLinux/Passenger, Node.js 24 |
| `src/http-handler.cjs` | Read-only API migration status, fail-closed |
| `src/database.cjs` | Future `mysql2/promise` pool (MariaDB, UTF-8, 4 connections); not called by startup |
| `package.json` | CommonJS app + mysql2 |
| `.env.example` | Placeholder environment variable names only |
| `mysql/0000_migration_ledger.sql` | Migration ledger only; not the school schema |

## Local smoke test

From `node-hosting/` on a machine with Node 24:

```sh
npm install
npm start
```

Then open `http://127.0.0.1:3000/api/health` (expected 503). Stop with Ctrl+C. Nothing is written to any database.

## DirectAdmin trial setup

Use a **separate staging subdomain** with HTTPS and a newly created MySQL database. Do not install over `ratsada.ac.th`:

- Node version: `24.20.0` for initial testing; request latest patched 24.x before production.
- Application mode: `Development` for test only.
- Application root: `rd-connect-node-stage` (outside `public_html`)
- Application URL: separate staging subdomain `care-test.ratsada.ac.th` after school approval.
- Startup file: `app.js` (CommonJS, required by CloudLinux Passenger).
- Use hosting-provided `PORT`; do not hardcode a public port.
- Install NPM dependencies via the Node.js selector. Check Passenger log if startup fails.

Credentials must be entered only through the host's secure environment editor, not copied to GitHub or chat. Do not add credentials before the API and MySQL schema have been reviewed.

**Do not switch the school website's PHP 7.4 or modify the existing Cloudflare Dev Worker/D1.**

The full migration, data protection, test plan, Cron/Push checklist and security caveats are in `docs/NODE-MARIADB-MIGRATION-PLAN.md`.
